# Brief
 * Controlling a uniploar stepper motor with 200 steps per revolution (SPR).
 * get Speed form the serial monitor.
 * get Direction from the switch.
 * get Steps from the potentiometer.
# Details 
 * In the code I'm not using the stepper library as it causes unnecessary overhead.
 * Instead, I'm dealing with the motor directly.
